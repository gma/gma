üëã Hello there! 
===============

I'm a freelance developer from Manchester, in the UK.

- üëç I like: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Linux, shell scripting, Docker.

- üí¨ Ask me about: OO Design, Refactoring, TDD, writing code that's easy to
  change, pair/mob programming, and automating all of the things.

- üî® I use: [Neovim] with [tmux-fuzzy-launcher] for solo projects, and VS Code
  for pairing. Today's dev tools are pretty great.

Work
----

In 2022 I decided to **switch my focus to full-stack JavaScript** (and/or
TypeScript, but I'm still [getting up to speed][exercism-ts]).

I also really enjoy Python. If you need help with either, feel free to get in
touch.

I've written a lot of Ruby (and Rails) code over the years, including my
[Agile Planner SaaS app][planner], and [Nesta CMS][]. But I'm taking a (fairly
permanent) break from Ruby professionally.
