üëã Hello there! 
===============

I'm a full stack developer, primarily using Python, JavaScript (TypeScript),
and Ruby.

I'm the founder and developer of [Agile Planner] (a project management app for
agile teams).

Code
----

I've got plenty of open source projects [written in Python] and [in Ruby].

Most of my JavaScript work has been for clients, but [seo-link-analyzer] is a
small project that's open source.

My most significant open source project is [Nesta CMS], a file based CMS built
on Sinatra.

I've also got a handful of Linux/dev-tool related projects, such as my [Vim
config] and the (rather magical) fzf-powered [tmux-fuzzy-launcher] for Vim and
tmux users.
