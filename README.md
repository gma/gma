üëã Hello there! 
===============

I'm a Python and JavaScript dev. I also used to do a lot of work with Ruby.

I'm the founder and developer of [Agile Planner] (a project management app for
agile teams).

Most of my recent work has been for clients, and isn't publicly available.
If you're interested in looking at some of my code, these projects would be
a good start‚Ä¶

Python:

  [Obsidian]
- [ngram-builder] ‚Äî a library for extracting ngrams from chunks of text

- [aventofcode-rain-risk] ‚Äî my solution to one of the problems from 2020's
  "Advent of Code"
- Or you could browse through all my [public Python projects]

  designing products, UX design, building user interfaces, writing copy, and
  mentoring.

- üí¨ Ask me about: Extreme Programming, Refactoring, TDD, writing code that's easy
  to change, pair/mob programming, and automating all of the things.

- üî® I use: Neovim and tmux for solo projects, and VS Code when pairing. Today's
  dev tools are pretty great.
