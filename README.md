👋 Hello there! 
===============

I'm a freelance developer from Manchester, in the UK.

- 👍 I like: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Linux, shell scripting, Docker.

- 💬 Ask me about: Refactoring, TDD, pair/mob programming, OO Design, writing
  code that's easy to change, and automating all of the things.

- 🔨 I use: [Neovim] with [tmux-fuzzy-launcher] for solo projects, and VS Code
  for pairing. Let's face it, today's dev tools are pretty great and it's not a
  competition.

Work
----

In 2022 I decided to **switch my focus to full-stack JavaScript** (and/or
TypeScript, but I'm still [getting up to speed][exercism-ts]).

I also really enjoy Python. If you need help with either, feel free to get in
touch.

I've written a lot of Ruby (and Rails) code over the years, including my
[Agile Planner SaaS app][planner], and [Nesta CMS][]. But I'm taking a (fairly
permanent) break from Ruby professionally.
