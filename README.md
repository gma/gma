ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! 
===============

I'm a developer from Manchester, in the UK.

I've got over 20 years of experience building software in Python, Ruby, and
JavaScript.

Work
----

I'm currently available for work.

In 2022 I decided to **switch my focus to full-stack JavaScript** (and/or TypeScript, but I'm still [getting up to speed][exercism-ts]).

I also really enjoy Python.

I've also written a lot of Ruby and Rails code over the years including my
[Agile Planner SaaS app][planner], and [Nesta CMS][].

Deployment
----------

Shipping stuff is fun. It's even more fun when it's a push-button exercise.

I like Docker, CI platforms, the slew of modern hosting platforms that
auto-deploy when you push your changes, and serverless functions.

Dev Tools
---------

Let's face it, they're all great.

When working solo I'm a fan of running [Vim][] (or [Neovim][]) inside tmux.
If you do too, check out the fzf-based [tmux-fuzzy-launcher][] script if you'd
like a quick way to fire up your editor in a new tmux window. ðŸš€

For pairing, VS Code is hard to beat. The LiveShare plugin is ðŸŽ‰ for pair
programming...
